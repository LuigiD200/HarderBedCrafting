# Harder Bed Crafting (Minecraft 1.12.2 Mod)

**Harder Bed Crafting** is a Minecraft 1.12.2 mod that replaces the vanilla bed crafting recipe with a custom method for creating beds. This mod changes how players interact with bed crafting, adding a new level of challenge and complexity to the process.

## Features
- New bed ingredients (items)
- New bed components (blocks)
- An alternative, maybe [exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_relationship_(programming)), way to make beds
  <!--Relational Model gag, that's high-level humor right there-->

## How to craft a bed
To craft a bed in this mod, follow these steps:
1. Craft a Bed Frame and place it somewhere.
2. Craft a Bed Mattress and place it on top of the Bed Frame.
3. Craft a Bed Pillow and place it on top of the Bed Frame with the Mattress.
4. Craft any Bed Blanket and place it on top of everything else.
5. Enjoy your bed after having wasted a lot of resources; you might need to rest!
